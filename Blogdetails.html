                 the question “What is code?” “Coding” is the most common term used by educational sites, but it’s a bit more
complex than that. First, there’s no one way to code — there are numerous languages used to code for different 
types of projects. Second, knowing how to code with a particular language doesn’t make you a programmer or 
developer.Though there is some debate about the overlap of coding, programming, developing, and other 
related pursuits,most people agree that to get beyond coding, you need to be able to understand logic and 
algorithms,languages, and communicate and collaborate with other people.Learning to code can foster both 
hard and soft skills that will benefit you in your career and life. The hard skills help you do cool stuff:create 
websites,apps, games, and software; analyze a web of data; automate complex tasks or tackle any number .

                thing with coding: If you learn to code, you can code to learn.” Don’t learn to code for coding sake learn because 
                you want to use code as a tool to solve problems. “Before you look at programming at all, figure out a problem that
                you’re excited about, something that’s going to motivate you to learn about the languages and tools available,” 
                advises programmer and blogger Mucyo Gisi. “And once you’ve built that really cool thing, you’re going to discover
                that you accidentally picked up a lot of skills along the way.” Before you start, remember Gisi advice figure out.

having a specific, meaningful goal motivates you to keep going.“Learning programming is like practicing scales,”
Gisi says. “It’s going to make you a very strong musician, but if you do that for years without ever playing a song,
you’re going to get very frustrated. It’s a lot easier to learn something when you have a reason to want to know it.”
